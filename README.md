# Waste-Material-Classification
This project develops an image-based Waste Material Classification system using machine learning to instantly identify and segregate common waste types (glass, plastic, organic, etc.).


# üóëÔ∏è Automated Waste Material Classification

Project Overview
This repository hosts a machine learning project dedicated to classifying various waste materials (e.g., cardboard, glass, metal, organic, plastic, paper) from images. The goal is to develop and compare different classification algorithms‚Äîincluding both traditional ML and deep learning approaches‚Äîto create an accurate system that can aid in automated sorting and recycling processes.

This project addresses a critical need in modern waste management by providing a scalable solution for material identification, improving recycling efficiency, and reducing contamination.

# Key Features

-Multi-Class Classification: Implementation and evaluation of models for classifying 6+ distinct waste categories.

-Algorithm Comparison: Benchmarking performance across several classifiers, potentially including VGG16, ResNet (Deep Learning), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

-Data Augmentation: Scripts for preprocessing and expanding the image dataset to improve model generalization.

-Performance Metrics: Detailed reporting on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

-Deployment Potential: Final model exports optimized for integration into external applications or hardware (e.g., smart bins or conveyor belt systems).
